Trajectory optimization approaches can optimally solve the problem of computing trajectories for multiple robots navigating in a shared space. However, such methods are hampered by *complex robot dynamics* and
collision constraints that *couple robotâ€™s decision variables*. We propose a distributed multi-robot optimization algorithm (DiMOpt) which addresses these issues by exploiting:

1.  **Consensus optimization** strategies to tackle coupling collision constraints.
2.  **Single-robot sequential convex programming** (SCP) method for efficiently handling non-convexities introduced by dynamics.
