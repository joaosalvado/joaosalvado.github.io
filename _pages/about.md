Trajectory optimization approaches can optimally solve the problem of computing trajectories for multiple robots navigating in a shared space. However, such methods are hampered by *complex robot dynamics* and
collision constraints that *couple robotâ€™s decision variables*. We propose a distributed multi-robot optimization algorithm (DiMOpt) which addresses these issues by exploiting:

1.  **Consensus optimization** strategies to tackle coupling collision constraints.
2.  **Single-robot sequential convex programming** (SCP) method for efficiently handling non-convexities introduced by dynamics.

**Coordination** of fleets of buses on the Dellrud Depot (top video), and on the Leipzig Depot (bottom video). 

1. A sequence of goals are assumed to be given by a Depot Manager which are then posted to the buses. 
2. **Paths** are generated via an **off-shelf motion planner** (e.g. OMPL) or a roadmap of Geo-located **motion primitives**. Moreover, a mixture of pre-computed and lively computed trajectories was also explored. 
3. Collisions between robots are solved by imposing a **precedences between robots** while accounting for robot dynamic models.
